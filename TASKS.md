# TASKS.md — Velura Project Work Items

Last updated: 2026-05-26  
Stack reality: Next.js 16.2.6 · React 19.2.4 · Tailwind CSS v4 · Prisma · Zustand · NextAuth · Cloudinary · @huggingface/inference

Status: ✅ Done · 🔄 In Progress / partial · 🧪 Needs verification · ⬜ Not Started · 🚫 Blocked  
Priority: P0 launch blocker · P1 core feature · P2 polish / growth

## Current Snapshot

- ✅ Full storefront: home, shop, product detail, cart drawer, checkout UI, order-confirmed page.
- ✅ Admin panel: NextAuth login, product CRUD, Cloudinary image upload/manage.
- ✅ Custom Bra Builder: 5-step flow, fit calculator, rich deterministic SVG preview, AI preview generation.
- ✅ AI Visualizer (EPIC 16): `BuilderVisualSpec`, `BraSVG` with 8 cup types + overlays, `/api/builder-preview/generate` with HuggingFace SDK + Pollinations fallback + Cloudinary caching, 20-color palette, fashion-accurate AI prompts.
- 🔄 Orders are not persisted — `POST /api/orders` returns a timestamp ID without DB writes.
- 🔄 Saved designs are stubbed — GET returns `[]`, POST stores nothing, no `SavedDesign` Prisma model.
- 🔄 Coupons are UI-only — client-side state, no `/api/coupons/validate`, no server enforcement.
- 🔄 Fit calculator has a cm → band conversion bug; full `50H` range not wired in size selectors.
- 🔄 Cart mutations (remove/qty) operate by `id` only, breaking multi-size items.
- 🧪 `npm run lint` — last recorded state: 5 warnings, 0 errors (re-verify before build).
- ⬜ `npm run build` not yet verified against current codebase.

## EPIC 16 — AI CUSTOM BRA VISUALIZER

Goal: deterministic instant SVG preview always-on; optional AI-generated ideal flat-lay product image on demand.

### Core (done)
- ✅ AIPREV-01 [P0] `lib/builderVisualSpec.ts` — `BuilderVisualSpec` normalized view-model, `specToHash()`, `buildAIPrompt()`, `buildPollinationsPrompt()`
- ✅ AIPREV-02 [P0] `BraSVG.tsx` — 8 cup geometries, padding/underwire/closure/lace/silk/bridal overlays, mirror transform for right cup, 20-colour FILL/STROKE maps
- ✅ AIPREV-03 [P0] Deterministic SVG always rendered; AI image is an optional toggle
- ✅ AIPREV-04 [P1] `buildAIPrompt()` — fashion-specific visual language per bra type, strap style, padding depth, fabric texture, closure hardware, colour with exact hex
- ✅ AIPREV-05 [P1] `buildPollinationsPrompt()` — short ≤200 char visual-first prompt for Pollinations FLUX (avoids truncation)
- ✅ AIPREV-07 [P1] `ProductPreview.tsx` — loading skeleton, error/retry, SVG↔AI toggle, disclaimer, spec-hash change resets AI state
- ✅ AIPREV-08 [P1] Cloudinary cache: same spec-hash never generated twice (`velura/custom-previews/{hash}`)
- ✅ AIPREV-10 [P2] Disclaimer: "Preview is representative; final fit and finish may vary."
- ✅ AIPREV-12 [P1] `/api/builder-preview/generate` — rate limit bypassed in `NODE_ENV === 'development'`

### Pending
- ⬜ AIPREV-06 [P1] Attach `previewUrl` to saved design and custom cart item on generation success
- ⬜ AIPREV-09 [P2] Prompt style presets: editorial flat-lay, ghost mannequin, fabric macro, line-art spec sheet

3. **STATE-08** — Fix cart `remove`/`updateQty` to use `cartLineId` composite key.
4. **SHOP-12** — Replace quick-add `size: 'M'` with a "Choose Size" flow or remove button.
5. **DATA-05B + DETAIL-09** — Fix fit calculator cm band bug; extend size range to `50H`.
6. **DATA-23 + DATA-15 + CHECK-12** — Add Order/OrderItem Prisma models; persist orders; recalculate server-side totals.
7. **DATA-22** — Add Zod validation to `/api/orders`, `/api/fit-calculator`, `/api/saved-designs`.
8. **CHECK-07 + DATA-19** — Wire coupon UI → `/api/coupons/validate`.
9. **DATA-24 + DATA-17/18 + BUILD-13** — Add SavedDesign model; implement saved designs persistence; attach `previewUrl`.
10. **FOUND-16** — Write `README.md` with setup, DB, seed, admin, and deploy instructions.

## Improvement Ideas (not yet tracked)

- Builder: add a "Start from a saved design" entry point once saved designs exist.
- Builder: show a mobile-friendly sticky bottom bar with current price + "Continue" on narrow screens.
- Shop: add a "New Arrivals" filter derived from `createdAt` rather than a hardcoded badge.
- Product detail: show stock/availability indicator once inventory tracking is added.
- AI preview: let users regenerate with a different seed to see color variation.
- AI preview: cache hit rate metric to measure Cloudinary cache effectiveness.
- Accessibility: audit drawer focus trapping and reduced-motion support for marquee/animations.
- Security: add `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options` headers in `next.config.ts`.

## Notes & Decisions

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| 2025-05 | Use App Router | SSG/ISR/client interactivity mix |
| 2025-05 | Use Zustand | Small client state, less boilerplate |
| 2025-05 | Use Onyx & Pearl theme | Premium editorial direction |
| 2026-05-25 | Track as Next 16 / Tailwind 4 | Actual installed stack differs from original CLAUDE.md |
| 2026-05-25 | Hybrid visualizer | Instant SVG avoids AI latency; AI preview adds emotional clarity |
| 2026-05-25 | HuggingFace SDK primary, Pollinations fallback | HF SDK handles routing; Pollinations is free zero-config backstop |
| 2026-05-26 | 20-colour palette | Neutral + Pinks/Reds + Blues/Greens covers full lingerie market needs; each colour has matched FILL/STROKE/SVG/API validation |
